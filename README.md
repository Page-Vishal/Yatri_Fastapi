# Yatri FastAPI Server

This is a FastAPI-powered backend for **Yatri**, a conversational agent designed to handle natural language queries and route them intelligently. The server is structured for easy development and testing.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

│   └── yatri.py # Main logic for processing queries

## 🚀 Running the Server

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Also, add the .env file at [here](./Code/Assets)
```
GROQ_API_KEY='API_KEY'
pgsql=postgresql://A:B@C:D/db_phone
```

Visit the interactive API docs at:
➡️ http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

---
## 🧪 Testing the API
Run the test script to send a sample query:
```bash
python test.py
```
This sends a POST request to the /chat endpoint and prints the response.

## 🛠️ API Models
➤ queryRequest (Request Model)
```python
class queryRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str
```
➤ messageResponse (Response Model)
```python
class messageResponse(BaseModel):
    message: str
```
---
## 📦 Requirements
Make sure to have the required packages installed. These should be listed in requirements.txt:
```
fastapi
uvicorn
requests
pydantic

```
---
## 📌 Notes
- The Code/yatri.py file contains the process_query() function that powers the logic behind user queries.

- The messageResponse model is used to ensure consistent, validated API responses.

- Modify queryRequest and messageResponse if your input/output schema changes.
